The following Features Should Be Implemented:

PART I:

    Implement a class that represents a race. Attribute should be the name of the race, date of the race and the name of the track.
    Select a .NET collection and add a few races to form a racing calendar.
    Print all races to the console (one line per race) and include all available information in the message.

PART II:

    Implement a driver class with a name property.
    Only 20 drivers are allowed to compete in a race. Add a method to the Race class that allows adding drivers to a race until the starting grid is full.
    Add a driver to any race. If the driver is successfully added to the race, print a message.

PART III:

    Simulate a waiting list. Choose a .NET collection to store drivers on the waiting list. You should be able to add as many drivers as you want, and you should also be able to take the next driver from the list. The driver taken from the list should be the driver last added to the list.


Good luck with solving this challenge. 

Feel free to think of additional features you can implement to work on your C# skills. Are you sure you understand everything we have learned in this course? If not, try to apply it in the project and learn how it works.

Remember that we are here to learn C#. There are different solutions how to solve this project. Most importantly, use the knowledge you learned during this and previous modules. Itâ€™s okay to solve this challenge multiple times with the focus on different C# language features or .NET types.

Expected Program Output:

    A printed list of the racing calendar.
    The name of the next driver from the waiting list.
